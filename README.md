01. Write a java program to accept 2 integers from the user and perform arithmetic operations based on user choice (any 1 of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
02. Write a program to accept an integer from user and print it’s table (till 10 times) in the following format: For example, if user enters 5, output should be:

                                5 x 1 = 5

                                5 x 2 = 10

                                5 x 3 = 15

                                                    . . .

     . . .

5 x 10 = 50
